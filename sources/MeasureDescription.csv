5,1.0,-,-,"A data product specification requires all towers higher than 300 m to be captured. The data quality measure “missing item” allows a data quality evaluator or a data user to report that a specific item, in this case a feature of type “tower” (name depends on the application schema), is missing.
Data quality scope: all towers with height > 300Example result of a completeness evaluation of a particular dataset:missing item = true fortower.name = “Eiffel Tower, Paris, France”tower.name = “Beijing Tower, Beijing, China”"

MCM (i,j) = [# items of class (i) classified as class (j)] The diagonal elements of the misclassification matrix contain the correctly classified items, and the off diagonal elements contain the number of misclassification errors."
