In the example, street view imagery is represented as points (circular dots in the figure), and the reference street network consists of seven line features of length L1, L2, … L7. 
Step 1: Snap each point to the nearest location on the street it is closest to. Snapped locations are marked by red crosses in the figure.
Step 2: Split the lines at the snapped locations and calculate the length of each split segment. Segments with a length longer than a certain threshold (e.g. 50 m) where no SVI is found are deemed as uncovered. In this example, we identify four segments with lengths l 1, l 2, l 3, and l 4 as uncovered segments.
Step 3: Rate of omission is thus calculated as the sum of lengths of uncovered segments, divided by the sum of lengths of all segments.
The example demonstrates a way to calculate the omission rate for the whole dataset. Besides, the omission rate can also be calculated at a finer spatial scale, i.e. for each geometry unit. For instance, it can be calculated at the street level, where the omission rate is calculated for each street segment."

MD209e,,,FT208_P,"In this example, there are three sequences of data, S1, S2, and S3. There are eight points in S1 and the interval distance between each pair of consecutive points is measured as d1, d2, … d7. Similarly, d8 and d9 are measured for S2 and d10, d11, and d12 for S3. Among these distances, d3, d5, and d6 are above a specified threshold (e.g. 50 m) indicating lack of continuity in spatial coverage.
The rate of spatial discontinuity in this example is thus calculated as:
where n is the number of intervals with a distance above the threshold, and N is the total number of intervals in the data."
MD210,,,FT210,"The amount of time (e.g. number of years, number of months, number of days, number of hours etc.) during which no data is present, divided by the total amount of time during which data is supposed to be present."
MD211,,,,"Quantity of data that suffers from imperfect coverage, divided by the total quantity of data."
MD211e,,MD211e.png,,"There are 15 street view images in the data. After running a computer vision algorithm to detect blurriness in images, three have been detected as blurry images. "
MD212,,,,"The number of records with data present, divided by the total number of records that are supposed to be present."
MD212e,,MD212e.png,,"There are five instances in the data, and each of them is supposed to have three metadata attributes – Attributes A, B, and C. Symbol ‘x’ in the table indicates a certain metadata is available for the instance
In total, there are 5 empty records, out of 15 (5 × 3) records that are supposed to be available. The rate of metadata omission is thus calculated as 5/15 = 0.333.
The rate of omission can also be calculated for each metadata attribute A, B and C."
MD213,,,,"The quantity of data where sensitive information is present, divided by the total quantity of data."
MD213e,,MD213e.png,,"There are five street view images in the data. It is found in Image 3 that there is one unmasked human face, and in Image 2 that there are two unmasked car plate licences. The rate of occurrence of sensitive information in this data is thus calculated as n/N where n is the number of data instances with sensitive information found, and N is the total number of data instances."
