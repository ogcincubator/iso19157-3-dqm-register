MP1,sample size,minimum of 30 points is normally used but may not always be possible depending on identifiable control points. For feature level attribution sample 10 % of the feature population.,,,Real
MP2,n,number of items,,,Integer
MP23,search distance,search distance from the end of a dangling line,,,Real
MP24,search tolerance ,search tolerance of minimum allowable length in the dataset,,,Real
MP25_1,maximum sliver area size,The maximum area determines the upper limit of a sliver. This is to prevent surfaces with sinuous perimeters and large areas from being mistaken as slivers.,,,Real
MP25_2,thickness quotient,"The thickness quotient shall be a real number between 0 and 1. This quotient is determined by the following formula:
T is the thickness quotient
T= 4 π [area]/[perimeter] 2
T= 1 value corresponds to a circle that has the largest area/perimeter 2 value.
T= 0 value corresponds to a line that has the smallest area/perimeter 2 value",MD25,,Real
